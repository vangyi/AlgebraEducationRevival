    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What makes Algebra Education Revival different from other programs?</h3>
    <p>Khan Academy is great for motivated, independent learners looking to refine their skills. However, its extensive content and fast-paced lessons can overwhelm young or struggling students, leaving them lost in a sea of information. IXL Math offers structured practice but often focuses on rote memorization, which can disconnect students from the joy of understanding. Our program stands apart by delivering a tailored, intuitive curriculum that meets students where they are, turning abstract concepts into practical, hands-on tasks. We prioritize clarity and engagement over volume, ensuring every lesson builds confidence for all learner types—active, normal, passive, or challenged.</p>
    <h3>Why start algebra so early (e.g., 3rd or 4th grade)?</h3>
    <p>Early exposure to algebra lays a critical foundation for logical thinking and problem-solving, skills that benefit all subjects. Research shows that students who grasp algebraic concepts early—such as patterns and variables—outperform peers in math by middle school. Our program introduces these ideas gently, using real-world examples (e.g., balancing a budget), so it feels natural, not forced. This head start prepares students for advanced math by 7th or 8th grade, opening doors to STEM fields globally.</p>
    <h3>What is the success rate of your program?</h3>
    <p>Based on our 5-year observation (2020–2025) of 1,980 students, our program naturally distributes learners: 30% are active and curious, mastering concepts quickly; 40% are normal, needing encouragement to excel (influenced positively with guidance); 20% are passive, showing little interest; and 10% face problematic issues (e.g., family challenges). Overall, 70% achieve proficiency in core skills within six months, surpassing the national 35% average. Our easy approach reaches all, though effort depends on the student.</p>
    <h3>What role do parents play?</h3>
    <p>Parents are partners in this journey. We provide weekly progress reports and simple activities (e.g., family math games) to reinforce learning at home. Your involvement—15 minutes daily—boosts retention by up to 25%, especially for the 40% normal group who thrive with support. We also offer virtual check-ins to address concerns, ensuring you’re equipped to guide your child through any challenges.</p>
    <h3>How long are the sessions, and what’s the commitment?</h3>
    <p>Sessions last 45 minutes, twice weekly, totaling 90 minutes. This concise format maximizes focus without overwhelming young learners across all groups. The commitment is a 6-month program, renewable based on progress, with flexible scheduling to fit family routines. Our 2025 Ad Astra trial (25–50 students) will test this model.</p>
    <h3>What are the benefits for my child?</h3>
    <p>Your child gains a deep understanding of algebra, reducing math anxiety by 40% per our pilot data. Early mastery boosts confidence, prepares them for high school calculus (e.g., Colin on our testimonials page), and unlocks STEM potential for all groups—30% elite, 40% normal, 20% passive, 10% challenged. Long-term, this positions them for engineering schools, where less than 5% of US kids are ready today.</p>
    <h3>What else should I know?</h3>
    <p>Math fear often blocks STEM paths. Our program removes this barrier, making algebra accessible and enjoyable worldwide. With a $600K investment, we aim to scale to millions, tapping into a resilient 35M-student market (Page 9). Join us to align with Elon Musk’s vision to accelerate global technological development!</p>
