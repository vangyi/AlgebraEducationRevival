            <h3><a href="#q1">What differentiates Algebra Education Revival?</a></h3>
            <q id="q1"><p>Unlike Khan Academy’s overwhelming 3,000-skill overload or IXL’s pattern-guessing pitfalls, we focus on three algebraic tools, two rules, and one principle—mastery over memorization. Kumon’s drills cause burnout, Mathnasium prioritizes grades over understanding, and AI platforms offer artificial learning. Our program is crafted through bold, independent research, driven by our intuition and decades of experience—breaking away from the outdated, mainstream methods that hold students back.</p></q>
            <h3><a href="#q2">Why start algebra in 2nd grade?</a></h3>
            <q id="q2"><p>Early exposure, supported by research, prevents math anxiety and builds confidence for Algebra I by 7th/8th grade.</p></q>

        <h2>Elon Musk: Revolutionize Math Education—Disrupt a <strong>$20 Billion</strong> Market and Lead 250M African Kids to STEM Dominance</h2>
        <p>Math education is broken: <strong>$20 billion</strong> wasted annually by U.S. schools on flawed models—mediocre results from major players like McGraw Hill, HMH, Pearson, and Savvas, who dominate the curriculum market. Supplementary tools like Khan Academy, IXL, Kumon, and Mathnasium try to fill the gaps but fail to address the root issues. Billions more are spent on outdated textbooks and ineffective training. No innovation, no solutions—until now.</p>
